- add monthly costs feature to automate them (net benefit is.. and after recurrent costs is...)
- explain 1 is for expense and 0 for income

to improve:
- dropdown menu and home page (background)
- reorganize functions in another file and then import it


To do now: 
- When deleting transaction refresh month page and not go home
- matplotlib of transaction, home and month (display with button)
- recurring costs
- display sales tax
